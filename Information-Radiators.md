- Explain : **To Do**: This category likely includes tasks that need to be addressed or completed but have not yet been started. These tasks could represent new features, bug fixes, or other improvements that are planned for implementation in the project.

**In Progress**: Issues in this category are currently being worked on by team members. These tasks are actively being developed, and progress is being made towards completing them. Team members might be actively coding, testing, or troubleshooting these issues.

**Completed**: This category contains issues that have been finished and closed. These tasks have been successfully implemented, tested, and integrated into the project. They are considered completed and no longer require further attention.

## Task-6 : Build and deployment status

- Assigned To : **Raghunath Kunigiri**
- Explain : Below are step-by-step instructions on how to set up email notifications, EC2 instance, and S3 storage on AWS to deploy our project:

1. **Email Notifications with Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**:
   
   Amazon SES is a cost-effective email service that you can use to send notifications from your application.

   - **Step 1**: Go to the Amazon SES console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/
   
   - **Step 2**: Verify your email address or domain. This ensures that your emails are sent from a trusted source.
   
   - **Step 3**: Obtain your SMTP credentials from the SES console. You'll need these to configure your application to send emails through SES.
   
   - **Step 4**: Configure your application to use SES for sending emails. You can use the SMTP credentials you obtained earlier to authenticate your application with SES.
   
   - **Step 5**: Test your email sending functionality to ensure it's working correctly.

2. **EC2 Instance Setup**:

   Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch virtual servers (instances) as per your requirement.

   - **Step 1**: Go to the Amazon EC2 console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
   
   - **Step 2**: Launch an EC2 instance. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your project needs (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
   
   - **Step 3**: Select an instance type based on your resource requirements.
   
   - **Step 4**: Configure instance details, such as the network, subnet, security groups, and key pair (if needed).
   
   - **Step 5**: Review and launch the instance. Once launched, you'll get an IP address or DNS name to access your instance.

3. **S3 Storage Setup**:

   Amazon S3 provides object storage with a simple web service interface.

   - **Step 1**: Go to the Amazon S3 console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
   
   - **Step 2**: Create a new S3 bucket. Choose a globally unique name for your bucket.
   
   - **Step 3**: Configure bucket properties and permissions. You can define access permissions and configure logging and versioning as per your requirements.
   
   - **Step 4**: Upload files to your S3 bucket. You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to upload files.
   
   - **Step 5**: Access your files. Once uploaded, you can access your files via the S3 console or programmatically using the provided SDKs and APIs.

4. **Integrating Components**:

   - Update your application to use SES for email notifications. Configure it with the SMTP credentials obtained from SES.
   
   - If your application running on EC2 needs access to the S3 bucket, ensure that the EC2 instance has the necessary permissions (IAM role) to access the S3 bucket.
   
   - If you need to store data generated by your application, you can utilize the S3 bucket for storage. Update your application to interact with the S3 bucket for storing and retrieving data as needed.
